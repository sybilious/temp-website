# Agentic Utopia

A mock AI agent product website packed with exaggerated marketing claims, questionable metrics, and satirical blogs. Explore the pages to discover a product that promises everything and delivers nothing.

## Pages

- `index.html` – Landing page with hero messaging and testimonials.
- `features.html` – Feature list that sounds impressive if you don't look closely.
- `pricing.html` – Pricing plans priced for comedy.
- `blog/` – Contains satirical posts about product milestones.
- `updates.html` – Changelog that documents purely cosmetic changes.
- `contact.html` – Ways to reach the imaginary support team.
- `404.html` – Because every visionary project needs a visionary error page.

## Development

Open any HTML file in a browser or serve the directory with your favorite web server.

Run the extremely thorough test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

This repo is ready for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): push to `main` and enable Pages from the repo settings. No build step, just static satire.
